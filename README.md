# React - Pocketbase Template
### Author: Emry McGill

## Description
I made this template to speed up the process of getting a web project up and running, as its the same process every time.

## Usage
1) Use as a template to make your own repository.
2) download your correct verison of pocketbase into the pokcetbase directory.
3) Use dockerfiles to deploy

## Feedback welcome!
Im always trying to improve, so if you see anything I can do better please let me know.
